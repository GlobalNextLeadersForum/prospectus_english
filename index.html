            <h1><span class="English-title">Our Prospectus</span></h1>
            <div class="text">In globalization, where societies are becoming increasingly flat, "differences" such as culture, customs, and religion are a strength, but they are also causing friction among people as never before. Understanding and respecting each other based on the premise of differences is the most important principle in a global society, and it is also a necessary attitude in an increasingly diverse domestic society. With the collapse of the Cold War and the advance of globalization, we are entering an era in which no nation can exist without relations with other nations, and the importance of building good diplomatic relations with as many countries as possible is increasing for every nation.</div>
            <div class="text">Based on our belief that "relationships between countries also begin with relationships between people," we have come to believe that Japan and countries around the world need people who understand and respect each other in an increasingly diverse international society and who can play a role in building good relationships with other countries on behalf of their own countries. I have come to the conclusion that such people are the "global leaders" of the 21st century.</div>
            <div class="text">Global leaders are not simply people with skills. It is about human nature itself, including the attitude of understanding and respecting each other based on the premise of differences, and the flexible attitude to deal with problems in a rapidly changing environment.</div>
            <div class="text">Therefore, global leaders cannot be formed overnight. This is because it is a human nature that is formed through long-term human relationships, character building, and learning processes. Therefore, we decided to create a place where university students who have the potential and will to lead the world in the future can meet together at an international conference as a "starting point," where they can autonomously grow into global leaders through their involvement in the program over a period of several years to several decades, and where they can deepen their human bonds.</div>
            <div class="text">The three key concepts that we have adopted in our efforts to create such a forum are that it should be a multilateral project, not a one-on-one project, that it should be a long-term project that does not end with a single meeting, and that it should be a project that actively builds unprecedented interstate relations.</div>
            <div class="text">Multilateralizing projects is essential to experiencing diversity, and as noted above, its longevity is also essential. In addition, as the conventional diplomatic framework gradually becomes untenable, we felt that it would be highly significant to proactively build new relationships, given the need to evolve previously relatively estranged or one-sided interstate relations into equal and interactive ones based on mutual understanding and trust.</div>
            <div class="text">So what is the significance of Japanese people and Japan leading this international platform?</div>
            <div class="text">The decline of Japan's international presence has become an issue, and pessimism about the country's future is widespread. The Japanese have been described as "poor at diplomacy" and "inward-looking. Furthermore, the Great East Japan Earthquake exposed the lack of "the ability to accurately disseminate necessary information to the world" and "the leadership to lead the world's discourse and actions to build a better international society. Japan is the country with the most urgent need to nurture global leaders who can take responsibility for their country and play an active role internationally in various fields. In this sense, it is highly significant that the Japanese people themselves are promoting this project.</div>
            <div class="text">But that is not all. Japan is a country that has achieved rapid growth after World War II ahead of the rest of the world, and it is also an "advanced country" that has experienced the financial crisis and super-aging of its population ahead of the rest of the world. Many of the challenges that Japan has faced and is facing, are challenges that the world will face in the future. This is where Japan's knowledge and experience should be put to great use. In this sense, this "Japan-originated platform" is of great significance to Japan and to the rest of the world.</div>
            <div class="text closing-text">In this long-term forum, we will provide experience, knowledge, and human networks to the participants representing their countries, and strive to create an environment in which each individual can grow autonomously. We will play a part in fostering global leaders who are needed around the world, and in the future, we aim to build a horizontal global network of leaders, which will eventually lead to good relations among diverse countries.</div>
